# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Functions are independent from classes (can be defined outside a class), whereas methods are associated with classes

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The constructor is used to initialize the object. The constructor is set within the object's class, with the same name as the class and with no return type. 
Constructors have two types:
  Default constructor (with no parameters)
  Parameterized constructor (has parameters)
